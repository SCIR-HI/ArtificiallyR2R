        "description": "it is a member of the class resorcinols that is 5-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzene-1,3-diol in which one of the methyl hydrogens is replaced by a 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-2-amino group. A beta2-adrenergic agonist, it is used (as the hydrobromide salt) as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airway obstruction. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a sympathomimetic agent, a beta-adrenergic agonist and a tocolytic agent. It is a secondary amino compound, a secondary alcohol and a member of resorcinols. it is a short-acting sympathomimetic agent with bronchodilator activity. it stimulates beta-2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, thereby activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP concentrations relax bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, and reduce inflammatory cell mediator release, especially from mast cells."
